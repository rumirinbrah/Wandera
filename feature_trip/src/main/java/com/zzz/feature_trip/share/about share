Sharing local data logic -

Exporting a trip - We convert the data classes to a JSON using kotlin serialization

Importing a trip - The json is decoded back to the data class & then added into the DB

Sharing the trip -
1 The JSON is written to a temp file and stored in app's cache
2 Use file provider to create a content URI for the file so that the other apps can access the file
3 Send the file via Intent
